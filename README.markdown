# Vimlander 2: The quickening

VIM was reborn like unto the noble phoenix.  And so it was as it always should be since the dawn of the end of times.

## To install

    ln -s ~/whereveryouputit ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
    vim +BundleInstall +qall

## Per user config

To have your very own custom vimrc additions or custom gvimrc just create these files ala:

    touch ~/.vim/custom_vimrc
    touch ~/.vim/custom_gvimrc

Then, sprinkle to taste with your defaults, undoing my craziness, etc.  These files are ignored by git and enable fun for all.

## On first run

You will see errors, but this is just Vim complaining about not having the plugins it wants installed.   Simply run:

    :BundleInstall!
